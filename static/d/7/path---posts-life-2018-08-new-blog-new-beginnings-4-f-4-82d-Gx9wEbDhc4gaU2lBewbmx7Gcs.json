Just getting the hang of it and posting some random thoughts.\nWell technically speaking it's not my first blog. I have tried starting a blog many times before, say around 5 times or so; and boy I have failed, miserably. Every single time I used to sit down, try to search for a platform for days, finalize on a theme for another couple of days and by the time I had everything setup and a couple of blogs posted, I found myself out of energy and will to write anymore. Maybe I was running after the idea of writing a blog to earn a lot of money. I guess it was too naive of me to assume that money would just start pouring from day one. Maybe I was running after recognition, I guess it was too naive of me to assume that I would start generating huge traffic from first hour. Enough whining, I started blogs in past with different goals. Didn't work out, no issues. New goal.</p>\n<h1>What's the plan</h1>\n<p>Unlike last time, and before that, and so on I do have a stable day job, no monetization needed from blog. Recognition, umm.. not sure if I really want that anymore. Don't get me wrong, I do like making new friends and connections, but that is not the sole motivation anymore. So why start a blog? Well I am software developer by day and freelancer during night, so I hardly get to write at all!!! Recently I also started reading books, (yeah wasn't doing that till now) and I like it. So I thought why not start writing again, whatever I can, whenever I can. I have read that writing improves your ( pardon my lack of word ) <em>writing</em> skills. So that's my motivation here, to improve my skills, sounds fair ?</p>\n<h1>What would I post</h1>\n<p>Umm... General random thoughts, I do some coding at work, so will post some tutorials and articles on various tech topics. At this point I am not really sure what would be the scope of articles, but general random stuff + tech is what I have in mind as of now.</p>\n<h2>Are you done?</h2>\n<p>Won't bore you anymore. This time I am not going to fail. Sincere motivation :), at least one post per week is what I am targeting for.</p>\n<p>See you around :)\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\n          >\n            <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8_pURh3l_s?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0;\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n          </div>\n          </p>"},"stubImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/78005/bc.png","srcSet":"/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/7f937/bc.png 25w,\n/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/f0c6d/bc.png 50w,\n/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/78005/bc.png 100w,\n/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/379f7/bc.png 150w,\n/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/ed021/bc.png 200w,\n/static/47b0f12f3e6f1609e32920844d0065d3/6fc85/bc.png 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"posts/life/2018/08/new-blog-new-beginnings/","prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hackerrank Solutions in Golang","description":"My solutions to hackerrank practice problems in golang with explantions.","categories":["hackerrank","golang","coding"],"date":"August 21st, 2018","path":"posts/coding/hackerrank/2018/08/hackerrank-solutions-in-golang/"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}}}
