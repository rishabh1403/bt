{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hackerrank Solutions in Golang"},"html":"<p>My solutions to hackerrank practice problems in golang with explantions.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h1>Starting Golang</h1>\n<p>I used to do competitive programming in my college days and from there on moved to web development. It's been a long time since I looked back and I think it's high time I should start coding again. I also started learning <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Golang</a> recently, so I think it would be better to practice it on some code snippets online and test it for time and space complexity along the way. </p>\n<h2>Choosing a platform</h2>\n<p>Now that the task is decided, it is time to choose a platform. There are many options out there. Some famous ones are <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/\">hackerrank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hackerearth.com/\">hackerearth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.codechef.com/\">codechef</a>, <a href=\"https://codeforces.com/\">codeforces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/\">topcoder</a> etc. I chose to go with <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/\">hackerrank</a> to start with. I have used all of these platforms before and <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/\">hackerrank</a> provides some basic questions for warmup and all, so yeah, will start from <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/\">hackerrank</a>. As I had no prior knowledge of <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Golang</a> I wanted to go with a platform where I could start from very basic.</p>\n<h2>Posting solutions</h2>\n<p>I would be posting solutions to all the questions that I solve as blog posts here explaining the approach I took, what problems I faced and so on. The solutions would be in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Golang</a> because that is the language I am trying to learn here.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned and see you later :)\n{{&#x3C; youtube UsNVC8hB7q4 >}}</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"posts/coding/hackerrank/2018/08/hackerrank-solutions-in-golang/","prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"New Blog New Beginnings","description":"My first blog.
